-- The zero part of the monoid structure of the linear types. Aside from
-- returning the value, this also returns an integer recording the number of
-- evaluation steps taken during the operation. This integer is used for
-- complexity analysis.
-- Because zerov and plusv are not implemented in terms of evaluation of terms,
-- we simply use an approximation here that is proportional to the actual
-- number of steps. In practice this means that we can take c_φ = 1.

-- The addition part of the monoid structure of the linear types. Similarly,
-- the number of evaluation steps is returned.
--
-- For sum types, we return zero on adding incompatible values instead of
-- throwing an error. This prevents D2τ (σ :+ τ) from being a monoid, but of
-- course, if a proper implementation that would throw errors does not in fact
-- error on a given input program, the implementation here would not introduce
-- values that violate the monoid laws either.
--
-- In particular, because the dependently-typed variant of CHAD is correct (see
-- Nunes, Vákár. "CHAD for expressive total languages." MSCS 2023 (to appear)
-- (also arXiv:2110.00446)), there is an external proof that those error cases
-- would be impossible, and thus that the cases that violate the monoid laws
-- here are also impossible.
--
-- We put up with this infelicity because it allows us to avoid having to model
-- partiality in our language, which is no fundamental issue but introduces a
-- large amount of administration everywhere that makes the proof harder to
-- read and to write.
